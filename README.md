# lean-vLLM

A lightweight vLLM implementation used as a testbed for production inference
engineering: scheduling, attention kernels, model architectures, speculative
decoding, and distributed serving.

The goal is not feature parity with vLLM, but comparable numbers on the parts
that are implemented. Each project ships a design document, a correctness check
against a reference implementation, and a benchmark against vLLM on the same
hardware.

## Roadmap

| | Project | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Attention backend abstraction | interface + Torch/FlashAttention backends done |
| 1 | Online serving + advanced scheduler | scheduler, async engine, OpenAI server, metrics and benchmark scripts done; numbers await a GPU |
| 2 | DeepSeek-style model support: MLA + MoE + YaRN | |
| 3 | Speculative decoding | |
| 4 | Disaggregated prefill / decode | |

## Install

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync                  # deps, dev tools, the server and the package, into .venv
uv sync --extra cuda     # add FlashAttention-3, Triton and the torch vLLM pins (NVIDIA only)
uv sync --extra serve    # the server deps alone, for installing without the dev group
```

FlashAttention-3 publishes no wheel, so the `cuda` extra builds it from a pinned
commit. That needs the CUDA toolkit on the machine running the sync and takes
tens of minutes; `MAX_JOBS` caps the parallel compiles. The kernels are Hopper's,
so the backend reports itself unavailable on anything but an H100 or H200.

Without it, and without Triton, the engine runs on CPU and Apple Silicon via the
`torch` attention backend, at laptop speed — enough to develop and test the
scheduler and cache against a small model.

The device is picked automatically (cuda, then mps, then cpu) and can be forced
with `LEAN_VLLM_DEVICE`. Off CUDA there is no `mem_get_info` to size the KV
cache from, so it comes from `kvcache_memory_gb` (default 2.0) instead of
`gpu_memory_utilization`.

## Quick start

```bash
uv run hf download Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --local-dir ~/huggingface/Qwen3-0.6B
uv run python example.py
```

```python
from lean_vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM("/YOUR/MODEL/PATH", enforce_eager=True, tensor_parallel_size=1)
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.6, max_tokens=256)
outputs = llm.generate(["Hello, lean-vLLM."], sampling_params)
outputs[0]["text"]
```

The attention backend is picked automatically and can be forced with
`LEAN_VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND`.

## Serving

```bash
uv run lean-vllm serve ~/huggingface/Qwen3-0.6B --port 8000 --served-model-name qwen
```

An OpenAI-compatible server: `/v1/completions`, `/v1/chat/completions` (both
with SSE streaming), `/v1/models`, `/health`, and `/metrics` in Prometheus
format (plus `/metrics.json` for the same numbers as a summary). Requests arrive at any time and
share one token budget per step, so a prompt being prefilled in chunks and a
batch of decoding requests run together; a client that hangs up frees its KV
blocks straight away.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "qwen", "prompt": "Hello, lean-vLLM.", "max_tokens": 32, "temperature": 0}'
```

Any OpenAI client works against it. `example_serving.py` is `example.py`'s two
prompts sent concurrently with the official SDK, reporting each one's
time-to-first-token:

```bash
uv run python example_serving.py
```

Sampling parameters the engine does not implement (`top_p`, `seed`, penalties,
`n > 1`, and the rest) are refused with a 400 rather than ignored, and a `model`
the server does not serve is a 404 — `/v1/models` lists the name it answers to.
Every engine flag is a `Config` field; `lean-vllm serve --help` lists them.
[docs/online-serving.md](docs/online-serving.md) covers the endpoints, the
scheduling flags and admission control.

## Benchmarks

vLLM is the baseline. Every project reports before/after numbers against it on
the same GPU, same model, same request trace — throughput, TTFT, TPOT, and
p50/p95/p99 latency, with the metrics that matter to that project called out.

`benchmarks/bench_offline.py` is the offline throughput number: 256 prompts
submitted at once.

```bash
uv run python benchmarks/bench_offline.py
```

`benchmarks/bench_serving.py` is the online one: requests arrive as a Poisson
process, and it reports goodput, TTFT, TPOT and end-to-end percentiles beside
the rejection rate. Point it at a running lean-vLLM or vLLM server.

```bash
uv run python benchmarks/bench_serving.py --dataset lognormal --request-rate 8
```

`benchmarks/sweep.py` runs it across a set of server configurations, starting
and stopping the server for each.

```bash
uv run python benchmarks/sweep.py --model ~/huggingface/Qwen3-8B \
    --suite rate --rates 1,2,4,8,16 --num-kvcache-blocks 8192 --out results/8b
```

No benchmark numbers are published yet. The backends were verified for
numerical correctness against a dense reference on an A100 back when the CUDA
one was FlashAttention-2; the FlashAttention-3 backend that replaced it awaits
its first H100.
[docs/benchmark-runbook.md](docs/benchmark-runbook.md) is the step-by-step for
producing numbers on a rented H100.

## Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

The tests check every available backend against a dense reference that uses
neither SDPA nor paging, so the same suite runs on a laptop and on a GPU box.
Attention backend design and selection are covered in
[docs/attention-backends.md](docs/attention-backends.md).
