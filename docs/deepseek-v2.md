# DeepSeek-V2: MLA, MoE and YaRN

Status: `DeepseekV2ForCausalLM` loads DeepSeek-V2-Lite and runs it eager on the
torch, FlashAttention-3 and FlashMLA backends. It has been checked against
transformers on tiny random checkpoints only, and FlashMLA has not run on a GPU. It has not yet run on the real 16B weights or
been benchmarked against vLLM.

## Running it

```bash
uv run hf download deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat --local-dir ~/workspace/huggingface/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat
uv run lean-vllm serve ~/workspace/huggingface/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat --served-model-name deepseek
```

The weights are 31 GB in bf16, so a 40 GB GPU is the floor. The config and
tokenizer load natively from transformers 4.56 on, with no `trust_remote_code`.
The runner picks the model class from `architectures` in `config.json`
(`lean_vllm/models/__init__.py`).

## MLA: the cache holds latents

Each token caches `kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim` values per layer. That is
the normalized compressed KV plus the shared rope key, with rope already
applied. Keys and values per head are not cached. For V2-Lite that is 576
values against the 2 × 16 × 192 = 6144 a plain KV cache would need, about 31 KB
per token in bf16 across 27 layers.

`MLAAttention` (`layers/attention.py`) is an `Attention` layer with its own
layout. The runner asks every layer for `kv_cache_shape` and hands its slice
back through `bind_kv_cache`, rather than reading head counts off the config.
Each step it:

1. scatters the step's latents into their slots;
2. expands the step's own latents into keys and values with `kv_b_proj`. When
   no row resumes (`keys_are_new`) these are every key the step reads, so the
   backend's varlen `prefill` runs with no page table and that is all;
3. otherwise runs `varlen_with_lse` causally over the step's own keys. A decode
   row is simply a row whose query is one token long;
4. reads the cached context in chunks of at most `max_context_chunk` keys, as
   vLLM's chunked context does. Each chunk gathers its latents, expands them,
   attends them unmasked, since all cached keys precede the step's queries, and
   merges its output into the running one by log-sum-exp.

`plan_context_chunks` packs consecutive rows into a chunk and splits a row
longer than the budget across chunks. The plan and its slots are built once per
step from `cu_seqlens_q_host` and `cu_seqlens_k_host`, so nothing syncs. The
runner sets the budget to `max_num_batched_tokens`: warmup expands that many new
latents, so no chunk expands more than the KV-cache sizing already measured.
vLLM uses a separate workspace of up to 64k tokens and reserves it in its
profile run instead.

Values are zero-padded from `v_head_dim` (128) to the query/key head size (192),
so a backend still sees one head size. The softmax scale is passed explicitly,
so the padding changes nothing, and the output is cut back to 128.

Chunking bounds the memory, not the compute: a step that goes this way
re-expands the whole context in every layer, one chunk at a time. Pure decode
avoids that on a backend with `mla_decode`, below. A mixed step still expands.

## Decode over latents: FlashMLA

A key's nope part is `W_k c` for a latent `c`, so `q · W_k c = (W_kᵀ q) · c`.
On a pure-decode step `MLAAttention` moves each head's nope query into latent
space with the key half of `kv_b_proj`, keeps the rope query as it is, and
attends the cached latents directly as one shared key head. The values are the
first `kv_lora_rank` entries of each latent. Attention is linear in them, so the
value half of `kv_b_proj` applies after it. Nothing expands. vLLM does the same
with `W_UK_T` and `W_UV`.

`FlashMLABackend` runs this with FlashMLA's dense decode kernel and uses
FlashAttention-3 for every other step. The kernel takes bf16 or fp16, a latent
of 512 + 64 and 64-token pages, on Hopper only. V2-Lite's latent fits. When the
backend is selected, `Config` sets `kvcache_block_size` to 64. The kernel's
schedule is built by the first layer of a step and reused by the rest.

FlashMLA publishes no wheel, and `flash-mla` on PyPI is an empty placeholder.
Build it into the project's environment from a checkout, against the pinned
torch. `uv sync` removes it again unless run with `--inexact`:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/deepseek-ai/FlashMLA.git && cd FlashMLA
VIRTUAL_ENV=~/workspace/lean-vllm/.venv uv pip install --no-build-isolation -v .
```

The backend targets FlashMLA's current interface, where `get_mla_metadata()`
takes no arguments and returns a `FlashMLASchedMeta`. `TorchAttention` also
implements `mla_decode`, as the reference, so the torch backend decodes the
same way.

## MoE

`FusedMoE` (`layers/moe.py`) stacks the routed experts into one `gate_up_proj`
of shape `[E, 2I, H]` and one `down_proj` of shape `[E, H, I]`. The loader maps
each checkpoint weight `experts.{e}.{proj}.weight` into its expert's row. The
forward pass sorts tokens by expert and runs two `F.grouped_mm` calls. Group
offsets come from `searchsorted` rather than `bincount`, which syncs on CUDA.
Routing follows the original V2 code: softmax scores, `greedy` or
`group_limited_greedy` selection, then either `routed_scaling_factor` or
`norm_topk_prob`. Tensor parallelism shards each expert's intermediate size.
Shared experts reuse the dense gated MLP.

## YaRN

`rotary_embedding.py` computes YaRN's inverse frequencies and scales cos and sin
by `mscale / mscale_all_dim`, a ratio that is 1 for V2-Lite. The attention layer
multiplies the softmax scale by `yarn_get_mscale(factor, mscale_all_dim)²`,
about 1.59 at V2-Lite's factor of 40. DeepSeek's rope rotates adjacent pairs,
GPT-J style, so its rotary embedding is built with `is_neox_style=False`.

## CUDA graphs

This model reports `supports_cuda_graph = False`, so it runs eager everywhere.
The context chunks are planned per step, and piecewise capture expects the q/k/v
pieces of the Qwen3 layer split.

## Testing

`tests/test_deepseek_v2.py` loads one checkpoint on disk into both
transformers' eager implementation and this one, in fp32 on the torch backend.
It runs three configs: V2-Lite's shape, one with `q_lora_rank`, and one with
group-limited routing. It compares a whole prompt, then a sequence of paged
steps built by the runner's own `prepare_batch`: a chunk, a resumed chunk beside
a cold prompt, pure decode, and decode mixed with a prompt. The block tables are
scattered. The paged steps run twice: with the context in one chunk, and with a
budget of 4, which splits a row across chunks and puts the end of one row and
the start of the next in the same chunk. `test_varlen_with_lse` checks both
backends' output and lse against the dense oracle.

Mutations the suite catches: resumed rows reading only their new latents, a key
gather that reads only the first page, uncut value padding, a dropped softmax
mscale, a dropped cos/sin attention factor, and unscaled routing weights. For
the chunked context: unmerged chunks, chunks attended causally, split rows read
from position 0, swapped merge weights, and an lse that is not accumulated.

The paged steps also run with pure decode both over latents and expanded.
`test_mla_decode` checks each backend's `mla_decode` against the dense oracle
at FlashMLA's shapes. Mutations it and the paged steps catch: the query or value
projection using another head's weights, and values read from the latent's tail.

The flash backend's `varlen_with_lse` and FlashMLA's decode have not run yet:
both need a Hopper GPU.

Writing it turned up an fp32 bug in `RMSNorm`. `.float()` and `.to()` alias an
fp32 tensor, so the in-place normalization rewrote the residual. bf16 always
copies, which is why Qwen3 never hit it.

End to end, `LLM.generate` ran greedy on a tiny random checkpoint with
V2-Lite's tokenizer, an 8-token step budget and repeated prompts. It matched
transformers' `generate` token for token.

## Next

1. Run the real weights: compare outputs with vLLM, then benchmark.
2. Run FlashMLA's decode on an H100 against the torch reference, then a Triton
   MLA decode off Hopper.
3. CUDA graphs for MLA and MoE, and a check of `grouped_mm` against a fused
   Triton MoE on an H100.
